## 1. Flask ML API : Salary Predictor App
Code : [SalaryPredictApp](https://github.com/imSrbh/DeployML-Flask/tree/master/SalaryPredictApp)  
In this project we are going to train a simple Linear Regression for salary prediction using scikit-learn and then create a flask web app.
There are core three files in the code repo:  
_model.py_ : We are gonna develop and train our model.    
_server.py_ : We will code to handle POST requests and return the results.  
_request.py_ : and Finally, we will send the requests with the features with the server and recieve the results.
