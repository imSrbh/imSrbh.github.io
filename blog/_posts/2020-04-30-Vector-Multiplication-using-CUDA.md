We will write a CUDA program to multiply two vectors, each having 10000 elements. Print the result.
- Print the execution time for GPU.
- Run the same code for CPU and print the execution time.
- Compare both execution time and explanation.

**Sequential Implementation for this is very easy one -**

```c++
for (int i=0 ; i<size ; i++)
{
	C[i] = A[i] * B[i];
}
```

**As the parallel implementation -**

We are going to launch a 1D Grid as the same size as the number of elements in the vector. And each thread is going to multiply two elements one from each vectors together and store the results back to the output vector.

### Code Explanation -  __[Code](https://gist.github.com/imSrbh/37abe5de04b6d187c2161be22eee83dd)__ 

Please Refer the code above `Code` link  &uarr;Â  ,  Below I have discussed the snippets in detail -

- Let's name our kernel `mul_vec_gpu`

  ```c++
  __global__ void mul_vec_gpu(int * a, int * b, int* c, int size)
  {
  	int index = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
  	
  	if (index < size)
  		c[index] = a[index] * b[index];
  }
  ```

  **This kernel takes 4 arguments -** Pointer to the input vector A and B , Pointer to the output vector C and size of a vector.

  Then we calculated global index. Here we are going to have 1D grid with multiple thread blocks so we can calculate global index by summing up block offset for 1D thread block and `threadIdx.x` values.

  Then we are going to check using a `if condition ` whether our global index is within the size of our vector.

  Then all we have to multiply the elements with global index in both A and B vectors and store the result to vector C.

  **That's it for our _kernel_ implementation.**

  

- **Now let's move on to the main function.**

  Here we are going to multiply two, 10000 elements vectors. First we set the vector size.

  Then we launched 1D Grid here with the block size 128.

  ```c++
  int main()
  {
  	int size = 10000;
  	int block_size = 128;
  ```

  Now we can calculate the number of bytes we need to hold each vector by multiplying size variable by the number of bytes per integer.

  ```c++
  	//number of bytes needed to hold element count
  	size_t NO_BYTES = size * sizeof(int);
  ```

  **Now, we need host pointer to A and B vectors also we are going to transfer the results from device back to the host as well**, So we need a host pointer to hold results of GPU calculation `*gpu_result`.

  ```c++
  // host pointers
  	int *h_a, *h_b, *gpu_result;
  ```

  Now we need to allocate memory for each of these pointers, we can do this using `malloc()` function.

  ```c++
  	//allocate memory for host size pointers
  	h_a = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
  	h_b = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
  	gpu_result = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
  ```

  Then we are going to randomly initialize A and B vectors.

  - For that I used `rand()` and `srand()` functions and limit the generated random value to value between 0 - 255 by performing bit-wise `& operation`.

  ```c++
  	//initialize h_a and h_b vectors randomly
  	time_t t;
  	srand((unsigned)time(&t));
  
  	for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
  	{
  		h_a[i] = (int)(rand() & 0xFF);
  	}
  
  	for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
  	{
  		h_b[i] = (int)(rand() & 0xFF);
  	}
  ```

  **Then we have to declare the corresponding device pointer as well**, we can allocate memory for each of those pointers using `cudaMalloc()` function.

  ```c++
  	int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
  	cudaMalloc((int **)&d_a, NO_BYTES);
  	cudaMalloc((int **)&d_b, NO_BYTES);
  	cudaMalloc((int **)&d_c, NO_BYTES);
  ```

  Here we are transferring memory for A and B device pointers from the host. 

  BUT C vector will be populated by multiplication operation by kernel, so we have to only transfer A and B vectors to device. 

  We performed memory transfer operation using `cudaMemcpy()` function. Make sure that you have set the direction of these function calls to `host` to `device`.

  ```c++
  	cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  	cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  ```

- Now we set Block and Grid Variable, so here our block variable size is 128 in X dimension which we have already assigned to block_size variable.

- We can calculate grid size variable by dividing number of elements in the vector by block dimension in X dimension.

  > _But if we look at our vector size and block size variables, here we are going to have 10000 threads, which is not fully divided by the block size value 128. In this type of scenarios, we usually add 1 grid size. This 1 will guarantees that we are going to have more threads than vector size._

  ```c++
  	//kernel launch parameters
  	dim3 block(block_size);
  	dim3 grid((size / block.x) + 1);
  ```

  Then we can launch our kernel with these kernel parameters and input arguments.

  We have to wait until our kernel execution finished here, so we need to add `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` function to block the host execution until kernel execution finish.

  ```c++
  	sum_arrays_gpu <<< grid, block >>> (d_a, d_b, d_c, size);
  	cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  ```

  After the execution finish, results of the kernel multiplication is in C vector in the device. So we have to transfer memory back to the host.

  For that again we are going to use `cudaMemcpy()` function. Here destination pointer will be `gpu_result` in the host source pointer is C device pointer `d_c` and we have to specify memory copy direction as device to host.

  ```c++
  	cudaMemcpy(gpu_result, d_c, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  ```

  Then we can reclaim the memory for pointers in host and device.

  ```c++
      cudaFree(d_c);
      cudaFree(d_b);
  	cudaFree(d_a);
  	
      free(gpu_result);
  	free(h_a);
  	free(h_b);
  ```

  This was the implementation of parallel multiplication in GPU.

---

### CPU Implementation

For that we added another function below the kernel code to multiply vectors in CPU `mul_vec_cpu()`.

```c++
void mul_vec_cpu(int * a, int * b, int * c, int size)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
		c[i] = a[i] * b[i];
	}
}
```

This function takes pointers to three integers vectors and size of the vectors as an argument.

So now we need to call this function from main() function. So for that added another pointer to hold  C vector and then we need to allocate memory for that host pointer as well.

```c++
	// host pointers
	int *h_a, *h_b, *gpu_result, *cpu_result;
```

allocating memory for this `*cpu_result` host pointer.

```c++
	//allocate memory for host size pointers
	h_a = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
	h_b = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
	gpu_result = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
	cpu_result = (int *)malloc(NO_BYTES);
```

After initializing vector A and B we can perform vector multiplication in CPU.

```c++
	mul_vec_cpu(h_a, h_b, cpu_result, size);
```

### Comparing the CPU and GPU result

Before freeing the memory we add this validity check whether the multiplication result in CPU and GPU is same or not.

```c++
	//compare_vectors
	printf("After Multiplication Validity Chaeck : \n");
 	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
		if (gpu_result[i] != cpu_result[i])
		{
			printf("Resultant Vectors are different \n");
			return;
		}below the kernel code
	}
  printf("Resultant vectors of CPU and GPU are same \n");

```

### Execution Time Calculation

In CUDA program, we usually wants to compare the performance between GPU implementation with CPU implementation and also in case of we have multiple solutions to solve same problem then we want to find  out the best performing or fastest  solution as well.

- We will note the CPU clock cycle before and after the operation (function calls), then the difference between those two will give us the elapsed clock cycles between the operations. 

  Then we can divide that value by clock cycles per second value and get the number of seconds elapsed during the operation.

  > _Most of our program will have execution time in millisecond or micro second range_

  

- **CPU Implementation Execution Time : **

  ```c++
  	//multiplication in CPU
  	clock_t cpu_start, cpu_end;
  	cpu_start = clock();
  	mul_vec_cpu(h_a, h_b, cpu_result, size);
  	cpu_end = clock();
  ```

  Printout the execution time :

  ```c++
  	printf("CPU mul time : %4.6f \n",
  		(double)((double)(cpu_end - cpu_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  ```

  Clocks per cycle is very large value, basically it's clock speed of our processor that's why we cast our recorded clock cycles and values after division to `double` values otherwise it will show you zeros.

  

- **GPU Implementation Execution Time :**

  GPU execution time - **Total execution time including memory transferring times.**

  I printed here data transfer time to both the directions and kernel execution time separately and finally we can add up those values to get total execution time for GPU implementation.

  

  Clock cycle before and after memory transfer from host to device - 

  ```c++
  	clock_t mem_htod_start, mem_htod_end;
  	mem_htod_start = clock();
  	cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  	cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  	mem_htod_end = clock();
  ```

  Kernel execution time - 

  ```c++
  	//execution time measuring in GPU
  	clock_t gpu_start, gpu_end;
  	gpu_start = clock();
  	mul_vec_gpu << <grid, block >> > (d_a, d_b, d_c, size);
  	cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  	gpu_end = clock();
  
  ```

  Clock cycle before and after memory transfer from device to host - 

  ```c++
  	clock_t mem_dtoh_start, mem_dtoh_end;
  	mem_dtoh_start = clock();
  	cudaMemcpy(gpu_result, d_c, NO_BYTES, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  	mem_dtoh_end = clock();
  ```

  Printing all these three operation - 

  ```c++
  	printf("GPU kernel execution time multiplication time : %4.6f \n",
  		(double)((double)(gpu_end - gpu_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  
  	printf("Mem transfer host to device : %4.6f \n",
  		(double)((double)(mem_htod_end - mem_htod_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  
  	printf("Mem transfer device to host : %4.6f \n",
  		(double)((double)(mem_dtoh_end - mem_dtoh_start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  
  	printf("Total GPU time : %4.6f \n",
  		(double)((double)((mem_htod_end - mem_htod_start)
  			+ (gpu_end - gpu_start)
  			+ (mem_dtoh_end - mem_dtoh_start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  ```

### Result Comparison

CPU implementation execution time is less than the **total** GPU execution time but if we look the kernel execution time, it is lower than the CPU execution time.

Most of the time in GPU implementation is consumed by the **memory transferring operations** between host and device. This shows how much of memory overload happen in a program.

> Since it was very straightforward calculation, so modern day optimized CPUs are able to perform these calculations very fast. When things are bit more complicated than this, then GPU implementations are easily outperformed the CPU counter parts.



This is because the execution time of the GPU version is dominated by the overhead of copying data between the CPU and GPU memories. This is an important lesson for CUDA developers: it only makes sense to execute something on the GPU when there is a significant amount of computation being performed on each data element.



**CPU Execution time for this 10000 size vector multiplication: 0.000030 sec.**

As we increase the size of vector we will see the difference, Now Overall GPU execution time is faster.

```powershell

### Performance of CUDA Application

In industrial level applications execution time is not the only concerns. We have to consider power consumption, floor space consumption for hardware and most importantly cost and budget of hardware as well.
